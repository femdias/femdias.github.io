I'm a Predoctoral Research Fellow at Cornell University's [CIDER](https://business.cornell.edu/centers/cider/). I did my Master of Arts in Economics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and my Bachelor in Economics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (FEA-USP). My research interests are development economics, applied economics, economics of crime and economics of education. My CV is available [here](https://femdias.github.io/files/CV Felipe Macedo Dias.pdf).
