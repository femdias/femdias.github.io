I'm a Predoctoral Research Fellow at Cornell University's [CIDER](https://business.cornell.edu/centers/cider/) and a Master’s candidate in Economics at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I did my Bachelor in Economics at the University of São Paulo (FEA-USP). My research interests are development economics and applied microeconomics. My CV is available [here](https://femdias.github.io/files/CV Felipe Macedo Dias.pdf).
