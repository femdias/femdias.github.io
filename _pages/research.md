<h2>Works in Progress</h2>

**Criminal power vacuum: The Effect of Ecuador’s Drug Lord’s Murder on Violence**

• Utilizing a novel dataset tracking criminal organization presence over time in Ecuador, I investigate the
impact of the murder of the leader of the largest Ecuadorian gang on homicide rates.


**Organized Crime and Societal Dynamics: Evidence from Manaus, Brazil**, with Paula Pereda

• Using Synthetic control methodology, we analyze the effects of the crime group Família do Norte on labor
market dynamics, educational attainment, and health outcomes.


**Was inflation higher in regions that benefited most from the Emergency Aid program?**

• Building on my bachelor thesis, this research seeks to study the effects of the Auxílio Emergencial
(Emergency Aid) program on the prices of food, using a DiD estimator with continuous treatment and a
panel dataset of geolocalized prices and beneficiaries in the municipality of São Paulo.
